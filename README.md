Subscription Service

Controllers/SubscriptionController is the API that handles the data
it keeps an inmemory mock database

Client/ClientSubscriptionService is the client making calls to the API

The TestProject1 has tests for the client, which works if the project SubscriptionService_Nuuday is also running.
